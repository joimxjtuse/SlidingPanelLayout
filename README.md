SlidingPanelLayout
==================

SlidingPaneLayout provides a horizontal, multi-pane layout for use at the top level of a UI. A left (or first) pane is treated as a content list or browser, subordinate to a primary detail view for displaying content.  Child views may overlap if their combined width exceeds the available width in the SlidingPaneLayout. When this occurs the user may slide the topmost view out of the way by dragging it, or by navigating in the direction of the overlapped view using a keyboard. If the content of the dragged child view is itself horizontally scrollable, the user may grab it by the very edge.  Thanks to this sliding behavior, SlidingPaneLayout may be suitable for creating layouts that can smoothly adapt across many different screen sizes, expanding out fully on larger screens and collapsing on smaller screens.  SlidingPaneLayout is distinct from a navigation drawer as described in the design guide and should not be used in the same scenarios. SlidingPaneLayout should be thought of only as a way to allow a two-pane layout normally used on larger screens to adapt to smaller screens in a natural way. The interaction patterns expressed by SlidingPaneLayout imply a physicality and direct information hierarchy between panes that does not necessarily exist in a scenario where a navigation drawer should be used instead.
